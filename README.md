## About
NetherEx is a mod that adds new biomes to the Nether. It also allows other mods to add their own biomes to the Nether...

Wait a second, you're lying aren't you? Fact check: it does not let Extended Nether Backport and Oh the Biomes You'll Go add their biomes.
So this is a fixed version of NetherEx. You can enjoy up at least 18 biomes in nether alone!
Works with:
- Vanilla Minecraft
- BOP
- ENB
- BYG

Works in:
- 1.15.2
- NetherEx is built from 4.0.0

Download is available in the release page. I may consider setting up a CurseForge project but NetherEx's author may respond to the compatibility issue soon.

## Declaration
This is NOT an official build. The mod retains its metadatas. Only a couple minor features are added.
